Introduction
-------------
Awesome IRC Bot v2 is a powerful framework which I have created for running a stable PHP IRC Bot. 
With easily customizable features such as modules, it's simple for simple users, yet has the capabilities for developers to hook advanced plugins into.

Beta Notice
-------------
Right now, the bot is in beta and will be subject to rapid changes in the way parts work, it is not recommended for the bot to be used in a production environment until v1.0 is released.

Prerequisites
-------------
* PHP 5.3+ CLI (will NOT run on 5.2)
* Screen or another shell backgrounding utility if you want to background the bot

Installation
-------------
1. Copy all the files to a directory of your choice
2. Rename "config/config.example.php" to "config/config.php" and edit it
3. Navigate to the directory in a shell
4. Run "php bot.php"
